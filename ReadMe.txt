(3) Author details: Liang-feng Zhu, Xi-feng Wang, Bing Zhang
(4) Introduction:
    Borehole2KML is a program developed with Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 on the Windows platform. Using Borehole2KML, 
    borehole information stored in an Excel workbook can be automatically converted into KML documents, and the KML 
    documents can be loaded into the 3D-rendering environment of a virtual globe application to intuitively represent 
    the spatial distribution and internal characteristic of boreholes.
